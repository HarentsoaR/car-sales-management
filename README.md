# car-sales-management
Project in PHP using the MVC (Model View Controller) structure for the car sales management

Create a new database 'vente' in the MYSQL admin or in the MYSQL console.

When the database is created, just import the 'vente.sql' file to import all the table that the project needs.

You need a server like WAMP, XAMP, NEARD, LARAGON to run the project !

Enjoy it
